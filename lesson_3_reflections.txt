When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It is quite helpful if you want to share your work to public rather keeping it private.
Also , it is quite helpful for code sharing and collabration.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
we usually do many commit .however , it should not be shared to public unless it is ready to do so.
Hence , maual update is preferred over automatic .
