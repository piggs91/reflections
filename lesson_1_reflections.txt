Why do you think some version control systems,like Git,allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs,treat each file separately?
Git is meant for programs, wherein multiples files are related to each other and make sense.
However, in Google Docs the purpose is not of programming. It is used to save documents which are not related to each other.
