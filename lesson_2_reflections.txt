What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git init will initialize the git repository meaning it will create all the required meta data to keep track of different versions of file.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area is a intermeditory between repository and working directory.
here we add files that we intend to commit.
How can you use the staging area to make sureyou have one commit per logical change?
we can give git diff --staged and get the information of the chages being done.
if it is more than one logical change ,we can easily identify that.
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Mostly , I am going to this feature while trying something different and which might break the code.
It helps to take a separate path from a working project and later we can combine if the new path works as expected
